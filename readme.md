An openEDG study guide aimed at preparation for the C++ certification exam

developed by Alex van der Meulen using in class excercises from COP 3003 and Edube C++ courses

CPA Certification Syllabus:

        Absolute basics
          machine and high-level programming languages, compilation process,
          obtaining the machine code: compilation process,
          writing simple programs,
          variables,
          integers: values, literals, operators,
          characters: values, literals, operators,
          dealing with stream and basic input/output operations.

        Flow control and more data types
          how to control the flow of the program
          floating point types: values, literals, operators
          more integer types: values and literals,
          loops and controlling the loop execution, 
          logic, bitwise and arithmetic operators.

        Functions
          functions,
          declaring and invoking functions,
          side effects,
          different methods of passing parameters and their purpose,
          default parameters, 
          inline functions,
          overloaded functions.

         Accessing data and dealing with exceptions
          converting values of different types,
          strings: declarations, initializations, assignments,
          string as an example of object: introducing methods and properties,
          namespaces: using and declaring,
          dealing with exceptions.

        Fundamentals of the object-oriented approach
          class,
          objects,
          class components,
          constructors,
          referring to objects,
          static members,
          classes and their friends,
          defining and overloading operators.

         Class hierarchy
          base class, superclass, subclass,
          inheritance: how it works,
          types of inheritance,
          inheriting different class components,
          multiple inheritance.

        More on classes
          polymorphism: the notion and the purpose,
          virtual methods: declaration and usage,
          inheriting virtual methods,
          abstraction and abstract classes.

        Exceptions - dealing with expected and unexpected problems
          what is an exception,
          catching and throwing exceptions,
          different classes and hierarchy of exceptions,
          defining your own exceptions.
